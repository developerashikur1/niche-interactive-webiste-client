## Description

After World War II, the use of auxiliary engines mounted on bicycles spread quickly in Japan, making it easier for people to move around and transport goods. This was the starting point of manufacturing for Honda. Ever since, Honda has given shape to wide-ranging joys and the fun of riding on two wheels, through such products as the Super Cub, which reached 100 million units milestone in 2017. In September 2014, Honda's cumulative worldwide motorcycle production reached the 300 million-unit milestone.

## Some Reviews

We purchased a 3 year old Honda Civic from John Banks Honda Ipswich approximately a year ago. We were assured that the car would have a thorough safety check prior to releasing it to us, and that the stone chips on the bonnet would be fully repaired. Upon collecting the car it was obvious that Honda had just touched up the stone chips with a pen, which was the incorrect colour. Then 100 miles after picking it up the brakes started grinding due to a sticky caliper having worn the remaining slither of brake pad. We had them repaired by Halfords (top service!) and Honda eventually paid the bill, stating that the brakes were notoriously difficult to check! They have attempted to repair the paint on two further occasions, each attempt was very poor. I thought Honda were meant to provide good customer service and paid over the odds for the car in order to receive this, however the quality and service we have received is sub standard.
